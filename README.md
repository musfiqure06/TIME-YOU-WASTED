# ⏳ TIME YOU WASTED

A dark, futuristic, and emotionally brutal web experience  
that visualizes how much of your life you trade for screens.

This is not just a calculator —  
it’s a digital mirror.

## 🧠 Concept

**TIME YOU WASTED** helps users realize how daily habits like:
- Phone usage
- Social media scrolling
- Netflix / gaming

slowly consume their most valuable resource — **time**.

The goal is not motivation.  
The goal is **realization**.
